--- The p6m platform standards, held against the typescript BASIC service archetype.
---
--- A basic service is its own SHAPE: it generates a bootable, 12-factor service with no domain, so
--- S2 (the CRUD API) has no subject here while S3-S9 apply in full. `p6m.spec{ shape = "basic" }`
--- says that in one place — it asks for no entity, and the oracle is told the shape has none rather
--- than left to guess a name it deliberately does not derive (S1).
---
--- Container-first (S8b): the SUT is the archetype's own .platform/docker/prd image on a topology
--- network. Docker is the single requirement — no Node or pnpm on the host, so this suite behaves
--- identically on a laptop and on a CI runner. No database: a basic service weaves in no
--- resources, so there is nothing to provision and `p6m.sut` takes no `db`.
